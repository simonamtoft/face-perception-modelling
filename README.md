# Face Perception Modelling
This project is the first project in the course [Cognitive Modelling](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02458) at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/).


In this project we will use a part of the [UTKFace dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/) to model faces from not smiling to smiling on a continuum, where we have picked one-year-old asian babies and filtered some of these away according to various deviations from the trend in the dataset, ending up with 300 images where around 50% of these are smiling.
